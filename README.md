### 3. Projects & Skills
#### 1. Self-Driving Car Project
- **Repository:** [self-driving-car](https://github.com/Aditya-139/self-driving-car)
- **Description:** Developed AI models for autonomous navigation, object detection, and path planning. Implemented Kalman filters, PID controllers, and MPC algorithms for real-time decision-making. Covered key aspects like lane detection, traffic sign classification, behavioral cloning, and vehicle tracking.
- **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, ROS, Kalman Filters

#### 2. Football Analysis Project
- **Repository:** [football_analysis_project](https://github.com/Aditya-139/football_analysis_project)
- **Description:** Detects and tracks players, referees, and footballs in videos using YOLO. Utilizes KMeans clustering for team assignment, optical flow for camera movement estimation, and perspective transformation for accurate distance and speed measurement. Provides insights into player movements and team performance.
- **Technologies:** YOLO, OpenCV, Optical Flow, Perspective Transformation

#### 3. Colorization Project
- **Repository:** [colorization-master](https://github.com/Aditya-139/colorization-master)
- **Description:** Implements real-time deep learning-based image colorization. Uses a pre-trained PyTorch model to convert grayscale images to color. The approach involves Lab color space conversion, resizing, and deep learning inference to generate high-quality colorized outputs.
- **Technologies:** PyTorch, Deep Learning, Lab Color Space

#### 4. Traffic Analysis Project
- **Repository:** [Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/Aditya-139/Traffic_analysis)
- **Description:** Analyzes traffic flow using YOLOv8 for object detection and ByteTrack for multi-object tracking. Processes video feeds to detect and track vehicles, estimate congestion levels, and enhance transportation analytics. Features real-time inference, annotation visualization, and API integrations for further analysis.
- **Technologies:** YOLOv8, ByteTrack, Computer Vision, API Integrations
